#Bevy Game practice


2D game to mess around with.

TODO:
- Movement system
- TileMap system
- basic scene system
- animation system
- basic AI system
- well-organized structure for project since I always hate coming back to a mess afterwards.





















 Structure: 
 use lib crates structure like labyrinth-game project uses since it looks pretty clean.
 Separate all planned system logics from each other to prevent code duplication and keep it tidy.
